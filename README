Here are all the necessary scripts you
need. However, Yttrius is just a predefined
wrapper for ASM , and you can easily replace
the ASM in bridge_cpp.yttrius with your desired 
ASM code.

bridge_cpp.yttrius has been setup
to handle most instruction sets and ASM
code. Just replace the ASM with
yours.

The Yttrius Exon language's templates
can all be included using :

Additional Notes:
If you are using this in VSCode, it is recommended to download the .vscode
folder as well, as there is not yet an official extension for syntax
highlighting and support for this language in VSCode "yet"

Although the syntax highlighting is completely off
it is pretty close to what the proper
syntax highlighting should be
